# 🏥 Healthcare Risk Analysis  

This project explores **50,000 synthetic patient health records** to analyze health risks such as **high blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose levels, and lifestyle factors (smoking, diabetes, heart disease)**.  
It is designed to demonstrate **Pandas, and Matplotlib** skills at an intermediate level.

## 📂 Project Files  
- `healthcare_risk_analysis.ipynb` → Main Jupyter Notebook (data cleaning, EDA, and visualizations)  
- `Patient_Health_Indicators.csv` → Raw dataset (50,000 rows × 14 columns)  
- `Cleaned_Patient_Data.csv` → Processed dataset with engineered features (risk score, high-risk flag)  

---

## 📊 Key Steps  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Converted categorical fields (`Gender`, `Diagnosis`)  
   - Created health flags: `High_BP`, `High_Chol`, `High_Glucose`  
   - Engineered a composite `Risk_Score` and `High_Risk` indicator  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of patient ages  
   - Average blood pressure by age groups  
   - Risk factors by gender  
   - High-risk vs healthy population comparison  

3. **Storytelling Visualizations** (Matplotlib)  
   - Histogram → Age distribution of patients  
   - Line Chart → Average blood pressure across age groups  
   - Scatter Plot → Cholesterol vs Glucose colored by risk  
   - Bar Chart → Lifestyle risks by gender  
   - Stacked Bar → High-risk vs healthy patients
